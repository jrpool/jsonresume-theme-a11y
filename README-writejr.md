# jsonresume-theme-a11y: Writing a `jsonresume` source file

## Instructions

The instructions for the `jsonresume` format are in the [schema of the `jsonresume` project](https://jsonresume.org/schema/). Those instructions take the form of a stylized example, so following them is not very different from editing an existing sample file.

## Examples

There are example source files in two repositories:

- The `jsonresume` project’s `resume-cli` repository contains an [example of a résumé](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli/blob/master/test/resume.json) of one [Richard Hendricks](http://pied-piper.squarespace.com/the-crew/).
- This theme’s repository contains an [example of a résumé](https://github.com/jrpool/jsonresume-theme-a11y/blob/master/docs/samples/pool-medium/pool-medium-std.json) of this theme’s initial contributor.

If you choose to start with one of these examples and edit it, you can get the starter file by selecting `Raw` on the example file’s Github page and saving the page, or copying and pasting its text into your editor and saving the file).
