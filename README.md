This is an accessible theme for [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org/). It produces a résumé or curriculum vitae that satisfies some of the standards of accessibility set forth by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group and the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) Working Group.

## Getting started

## Deployment

If you are familar with NPM, you should be done with this in no time.

If you already have an NPM account, you can run `npm login` and enter your username and password. If not, you can run `npm adduser` and fill in the proper fields.

If you changed the dependencies or added new ones, you'll want to run `npm install` again, and just to make sure, run `npm update` to get the latest version of each dependency.

When you are done with that, you may go into your package.json, and edit the version number. When all of the above is finished, you may run `npm publish` to release your theme to the public. Now everyone can use your theme with their resume.

When updating your theme, you'll need to change the version number and run `npm publish` again.
